# Modeling shows that the NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir has two modes of action and yields a shorter estimate of the hepatitis C virus half-life

## Background 
Hepatitis C virus is a major health burden in today's World, affecting over 150 million people. This virus often leads to further health complications and is one of the leading causes of liver cancer. Current treatment seeks to target non-structural (NS) viral protein. One of particular interest being NS5A which plays an important role in viral replication and infectious particle release. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of daclatasvir, a new NS5A drug target, and the current most common drug to treat HCV IFN-\alpha.  

## Objective 
This project's objective was to replicate the viral dynamic model demonstrated in this paper...
