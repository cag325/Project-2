# Validating a Comprehensive Kinetic Modeling of $[rac-C_2H_4(1-indenyl)_2ZrMe_2]$-Catalyzed 1-Hexene Polymerization

## Background 
  Olefins serve as one of the most utilized compounds in the chemical industry and a common building block for polyermization processes. However, their high reactivity at times poses a challenge for controling the manner of polymerization and the avoidance of undesired side products. Thus, current research is being devoted to increasing the efficiency of polymerization reactions with emphasis on the control of the site of polymerization. The use of single active site catalysis serves as a promising solution for polymerization control. 
  
  The paper under investigation in this project sought to attain a mechanistic understanding of olefin polymerization reactions catalyzed by single active site catalysts.
